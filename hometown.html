        <p>
          I come from <strong>Kepanjen</strong>, a district in Malang Regency,
          East Java. Kepanjen has been the administrative center of Malang
          Regency since 2008. This area is known for its peaceful atmosphere,
          friendly people, and its strategic location connecting the city of
          Malang with the southern region.

        <h2 class="section-title">A Brief History</h2>
        <p>
          Kepanjen, Malang has a long history that begins with the legend of
          Raden Panji Pulang Jiwo, a 17th-century figure who fought to defend
          Malang and married Princess Probo Retno, which became the origin of
          the name “Kepanjen.” During the Dutch colonial era, Kepanjen developed
          rapidly with the construction of government offices, Kepanjen Station,
          and the Panggungrejo Sugar Factory, which reached its peak production
          in 1930 but was later dismantled during the Japanese occupation.
          Formerly the center of Kawedanan Kepanjen, this area was later
          abolished and in 2008 designated as the capital of Malang Regency.
          Kepanjen has also witnessed major tragedies, such as the Sengguruh Dam
          truck accident in 1985, which killed 49 people, and the Kanjuruhan
          Stadium riot in 2022, which claimed 135 lives; both are now
          commemorated with monuments at the sites.
